Project Description: Personal Portfolio Webpage
This project details the creation of a clean, professional, and responsive single-page portfolio website using fundamental web technologies: HTML and CSS. The primary goal is to design an elegant online space for a developer to showcase their skills, feature their best work, and provide a clear point of contact for potential employers or collaborators. As a foundational project, it demonstrates a strong command of semantic HTML structure and modern CSS styling techniques, including responsive design.

The website will be structured as a single-page application, where users can navigate to different sections smoothly without leaving the page. A persistent navigation bar at the top of the page will contain links (e.g., "About," "Projects," "Contact") that scroll the user to the corresponding section of the page. This creates an intuitive and seamless user experience.

The core content will be divided into distinct sections:

Hero/About Section: This will be the first thing a visitor sees, featuring a compelling headline, a brief professional summary, and perhaps a profile picture. It serves as a concise introduction to who the developer is and what they do.

Projects Section: This is the centerpiece of the portfolio. Each project will be displayed in a visually appealing card format, including a title, a short description, the technologies used, and links to the live project and its source code (e.g., on GitHub). This section is crucial for demonstrating practical skills and experience.

Contact Section: A simple and accessible section containing links to professional profiles like LinkedIn and GitHub, along with an email address or a simple contact form. This provides a clear call-to-action for visitors who wish to get in touch.

A key requirement of this project is its responsive design. The layout will be built using CSS Flexbox or Grid to ensure that it looks great and functions perfectly on all devices, from wide-screen desktops to mobile phones. This adaptability is essential for modern web development and showcases an understanding of user-centric design principles. The final deliverable will be a polished, professional, and fully functional portfolio that serves as an effective tool for career advancement.
